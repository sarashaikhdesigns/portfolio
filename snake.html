      In this conceptual look, I explore the symbolic parallels between women and snakes, drawing on themes of seduction, danger, and transformation. The connection can be traced back to the biblical story of Eve and the serpent, with snakes representing temptation and knowledge. This symbolism continues in various myths and cultures, from Medusa’s serpentine head in Greek mythology to the powerful Nāginis in Hinduism. The project examines how women have been shaped and manipulated throughout history, akin to how we interact with objects, and reflects on how society often casts women as figures of seduction and danger.

      The look itself is designed with a skintight snakeskin bodysuit made from mesh and latex to mimic the texture of snake scales, representing both sensuality and concealment. The sculptural top, inspired by Zaha Hadid’s furniture, explores objectification by reflecting how women are molded and positioned like functional objects. Material exploration was key, with real snakeskin swatches influencing fabric choices, while the bioluminescent feature symbolizes transformation and hidden power. This project works to merge organic and futuristic forms to challenge societal perceptions of women, stripping away the gaze and expression to create an unreadable, shifting entity that questions traditional narratives.
