These visual narratives highlight the urgency of the issue, offering both educational insight and an emotional call for action. With strong imagery and poignant symbolism, the posters aim to create a visual dialogue that encourages empathy and ignites a passion for change, with a clear message that menstrual equity is a human right.

    The campaign’s short film tells the intimate story of a girl slicing into a pomegranate, with the fruit acting as a metaphor for menstruation. As she cuts, eats, and interacts with the pomegranate, the film subtly explores themes of empowerment, resilience, and the connection between nourishment and the cycle of life. The symbolism of the pomegranate, known for its richness and vitality, speaks to the strength and complexity of menstruation, while challenging the stigma that surrounds it. Through this piece, the film aims to provoke thought and stir action toward a more inclusive society.
