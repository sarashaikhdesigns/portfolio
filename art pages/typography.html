        Polaris (the North Star) has been used as a guide in navigation and a symbol in folklore. Its meaning and presence inspired me to create this art piece merging historical use with modern aesthetics. I used cyanotype printing, a sun dying process for the creation of blueprints, adding another asset of the sky’s influence. The theme of navigation is integrated throughout the piece, with use of asterisks, symbolism within drawings, and overlays of annotations.
