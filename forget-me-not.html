      Forget Me Not is a multifaceted project born from a poem I wrote, inspired by flowers collected from urban landscapes. The poem serves as the heart of the project, guiding the exploration of themes such as nature, memory, and artistic expression. Through the creation of a book, animation, and coded website, this project transforms the essence of the poem into a sensory experience, inviting viewers to reflect on the fleeting beauty of both nature and memory. Each medium builds on the poem’s core message, blending personal reflection with universal emotions.

      The first part is a conceptual book that delves into themes of memory, loss, and the complex nature of identity. Through a combination of visual storytelling and personal reflection, this book explores the delicate balance between remembering and forgetting. Each page of the book merges abstract visuals with intimate text, creating a space for reflection and evoking the deeply emotional process of how memory shapes who we are. The design choices, such as the use of mixed media and varied textures, are intended to immerse the viewer in the layered experience of navigating memory, identity, and the passage of time.

              The accompanying animation brings the story of Forget Me Not to life, enhancing its themes of impermanence and transformation. The animation explores memory through fluid, dreamlike transitions, mirroring the way thoughts and memories fade, evolve, or become distorted. With its ethereal motion and surreal visuals, the animation serves as a powerful extension of the book, using movement and sound to evoke the emotional complexity of memory. It aims to transport viewers into a world where the boundaries between reality and recollection blur, allowing them to experience the fragility and beauty of memory.

    The Forget Me Not website transforms the narrative of memory into an interactive digital experience. Through creative coding, the website mirrors the book’s themes of memory and identity by inviting users to explore a non-linear journey of discovery. Interactive elements encourage visitors to engage with the content in personal and unexpected ways, offering them a chance to reflect and navigate through a digital landscape that evokes the fluidity of memory. The clean, minimalist design, paired with subtle animations and transitions, ensures that the user’s focus remains on the reflective journey while seamlessly integrating the book and animation into a unified experience.
